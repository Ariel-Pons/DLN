# DLN
# Bold and italics
## Italics:
use asterisks *example*
## Bold:
use two asterisks **example**

To have actual asterisk in test: use escape character \.

Prevents further bolding or italicisation: \*example*


_Underscores_ also act like asterisks: __two for bold__

To show a single backslash, need another one before it: \\

You can combine italics and bolding by using a combination of italics and asterisks. _**example**_
## Line ruling

Need at least 3 minus signs
---
or underscores
___

Quotes: use > sign

quotes can be multi-line:
>quote
quote<

## Code blocks

to make a code block in your text, use (and close with) three back-ticks. can be multi-line.

```code```

can also have codes withing text with just one back-tick `example`


## Tables
Can make simple tables with pipe symbol and minus signs:
 | column 1 | column 2 | column 3 |
 |----------|----------|----------|
 |  item 1  |  item 2  | item 3   |


##ordered lists
1. first item
1. second item. automatically counts; don't to use different numbers
2. third item

to do sub item, lead point with 4 spaces

1. first item
    1. pointer
1. second item


Unordered lists: use asterisk or minus sign
* item 1
* item 2
* item 3
Sub-listing follows same pattern

checklists: minus space opensquarebracket space closesquarebracket
- [ ] point 1
- [ ] point 2

To tick, fill with x
- [x] point


## Links and images
Link to document: [link name](link)

Image: put exclamation mark before link: ![image name which is optional](image link)

by default, image will fill up width of page.

Can link to other folders with forward slashes. eg 'please read [Results](/results/) for up-to-date results (must spell file names correctly, including caps)
