# Bold and italics
## Italics:
use asterisks *example*
## Bold:
use two asterisks **example**
To have actual asterisk in test: use escape character \.
Prevents further bolding or italicisation: \*example*
_Underscores_ also act like asterisks: __two for bold__
To show a single backslash, need another one before it: \\
You can combine italics and bolding by using a combination of italics and asterisks. _**example**_
## Line ruling:
Need at least 3 minus signs

or underscores
