# Bold and italics
## Italics:
use asterisks *example*
## Bold:
use two asterisks **example**

To have actual asterisk in test: use escape character \.

Prevents further bolding or italicisation: \*example*


_Underscores_ also act like asterisks: __two for bold__

To show a single backslash, need another one before it: \\

You can combine italics and bolding by using a combination of italics and asterisks. _**example**_

---
or underscores
